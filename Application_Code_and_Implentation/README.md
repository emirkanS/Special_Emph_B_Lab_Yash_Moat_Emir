The vivado project is located in "project_1" directory.

The platform project and the application project are located in "Vitis_Final_Project" directory.

Some files are missed in "project_1" directory; Because getting error for committing them to
the repo, also failed to upload it as .rar file.

So that I uploaded all project files as a .rar file on google drive
Could you please professor check them via the following link?
