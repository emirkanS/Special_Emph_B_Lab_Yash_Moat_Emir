LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell pmod_design_with_uart_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) pmod_design_with_uart_i/mdm_1/U0/MDM_Core_I1/JTAG_CONTROL_I/sel_n_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell pmod_design_with_uart_i/PmodCLS_0/inst/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/QSPI_LEGACY_MD_GEN.QSPI_CORE_INTERFACE_I/FIFO_EXISTS.CLK_CROSS_I/LOGIC_GENERATION_CDC.RX_FIFO_RST_AX2S_1/GENERATE_LEVEL_P_S_CDC.SINGLE_BIT.CROSS_PLEVEL_IN2SCNDRY_IN_cdc_to in site SLICE_X34Y134 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDRE cell pmod_design_with_uart_i/PmodCLS_0/inst/axi_quad_spi_0/U0/NO_DUAL_QUAD_MODE.QSPI_NORMAL/QSPI_LEGACY_MD_GEN.QSPI_CORE_INTERFACE_I/FIFO_EXISTS.CLK_CROSS_I/LOGIC_GENERATION_CDC.RX_FIFO_RST_AX2S_1_CDC_1 is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
